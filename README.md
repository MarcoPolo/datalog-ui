![CI](https://github.com/MarcoPolo/datalog-ui/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master)
## Features

* Differential Datalog
* LeapFrogTrieJoin
* Queries are JS


## TODOs

### Hook up to React

### Nicer update semantics
Kind of clunky (and error prone) to retract the whole thing, then assert a new thing

### Notify on change (or when you should rerun a query)

### Hook up to React Native

### Switch over to immutable types. May perform better, because of structural sharing
