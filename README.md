![CI](https://github.com/MarcoPolo/datalog-ui/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master)
## Features

* Differential Datalog
* LeapFrogTrieJoin
* Queries are JS


## TODO

### Hook up to React

### Notify on change (or when you should rerun a query)

### Hook up to React Native

### Switch over to immutable types. May perform better, because of structural sharing
